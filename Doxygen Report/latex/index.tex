Here you should tell us about how your application works. If it\textquotesingle{}s a game then how to play, any special rules you have, etc. Also, explain any non-\/trivial design decisions you make, like how your ball gets its position updated, how you designed your buffer for readchar(), etc. You should also comment on the stability of your code. Any big bugs should be listed here. Basically, anything that you think we need to know in general about your project should go here.

Our project is a system that intends to protect a house by providing safety and security insights. The \char`\"{}\+Safety\char`\"{} aspect of the system alerts the user of dangers such as an active fire or water leak, both of which would damage a house.
